# Insights:

Dashboard 1

  Price of gas prices in the US is very volatile depending on many major global events such as:

    1980: Start of Iran-Iraq War
    2008-2009: Recession where drop in average oil prices in US dropped by 2.4 dollars per gallon

Dashboard 2

    Even with increase in the number of oil wells in the US, the production hasn’t increased substantially.
    However, in recent years the production of oil in the US has increased (from 2006 onwards)
    Total US Oil Consumption had dropped in 2008-2009.
    The states that have the maximum consumption of oil being Texas, California, Louisiana and Florida.
    New York’s gas consumption reduced from 1978 onwards and it is the fifth biggest consumer of oil in the US.

Dashboard 3

    Texas is the biggest consumer and producer of oil in the US mainland.
    Substantial oil production occurs in very few US states: Texas, California, Louisiana, Oklahoma
    and Wyoming.
    Consumption of oil is higher on the east coast in comparison to northern US.

Dashboard 4

    There is a decrease in %of oil imports from the Persian Gulf countries (with 2001 as the reference year).
    This is the same case with the OPEC countries, with only 2 out of the 7 major suppliers of oil to the US showing any increase in the amount of crude oil imported.
    The majority of the oil imports into the US has shifted over the years from the middle east to Canada, which is the single largest exporter of oil to the US in 2014.
    Overall import of crude oil into the US has been declining from 2006. The production of crude oil in the US has increased to keep the supply of oil constant over the years.

Dashboard 5

    The variable that affects the end user gas price the most is price of crude oil with a correlation coefficient of 0.9857922.

Dashboard 6

    Change in Saudi Arabia crude oil production was negatively correlated with US Crude Oil First Purchase Price.
    This can be seen in several years 1982-1984, 1986-1989, 1991, 1998.
    However as the US Crude Oil imports have decreased from the Persian Gulf and OPEC countries 
    in the recent years there seems to be little correlation with the Saudi Arabia oil production and
    the US Crude Oil First Purchase Price.

Dashboard 7

    As the production of crude oil in the US is decreasing from 1985-2009, whereas the consumption has been increasing steadily from 1991-2005.
    The crude oil gas price shows a steady increase during this period.
